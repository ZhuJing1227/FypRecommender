It has been referred to in various food publications as Singapore’s national seafood dish or even Singapore’s national dish.The dish consists of deep-fried crabs that are served in a chilli- and tomato-based gravy.9 Mud crabs are normally used and these are usually Sri Lankan, Burmese or Filipino in origin.After the crab has been cleaned and chopped into smaller pieces, it is deep-fried in oil and then deep-fried again in the gravy. Corn flour and beaten eggs are added near the end of the cooking process to thicken the gravy.As the crab is served with the shell on, the dish is typically eaten with one’s hands. Most restaurants will therefore provide wet towels or washing bowls. The pincers contain the most meat, but the meat from the body and legs tends to be smoother. To access the meat, diners have to strip away the somewhat intact but cracked shell. Sometimes they may have to crack the shell further using nutcrackers and mallets provided by the restaurants. The top shell, which is separated from the main body, may contain roe if the crab was female.Bread is often eaten with chilli crab. A favourite way of eating is to sop up the spicy sweet and sour gravy with the bread, which could be soft white bread, baguette or fried Chinese buns called mantou.",,"Hai Zhong Bao Live Seafood ,Ang Mo Kio Ave 3, #01-2508 Block 422"

The cockles and other meats are usually put in last in order to retain their juiciness and prevent overcooking.A hot fire gives a wok hei (Cantonese for “smoky aroma”) essential to this dish, and a charcoal fire is believed to provide the best flavours. Skilled control of the fire lends the dish its trademark smoky fragrance, which is also the mark of a good plate of char kway teow.As late as the 1950s, some hawkers used firewood instead of gas fires to cook char kway teow, so as to infuse the dish with a smoky flavour.Sweet black soya sauce, sweet flour sauce, light soya sauce and fish sauce give colour and flavour to the dish. A savoury, sour chilli sauce is typically added at the end or placed at the side of the dish for those who want a spicier char kway teow.Hawkers usually cook each dish individually, ensuring that each portion is thoroughly flavoured with the ingredients before serving.",," Char Kway Teow.

8,Japanese Bento,4.6,"A bento  is a single-portion take-out or home-packed meal of Japanese origin. Outside Japan, it is common in Chinese and Korean cuisines, as well as in Southeast Asian cuisines where rice is the main staple food. A traditional bento may contain rice or noodles with fish or meat, often with pickled and cooked vegetables in a box.Containers range from mass-produced disposables to hand-crafted lacquerware. Often various dividers are used to separate ingredients or dishes, especially those with strong flavors, to avoid them affecting the taste of the rest of the meal. A typical divider is green plastic grass (referred to as 'sushi grass' in the United States). This also works to stem the growth of bacteria.Bento are readily available in many places throughout Japan, including convenience stores, bento shops, railway stations, and department stores. However, Japanese homemakers often spend time and energy on carefully prepared box lunches for their spouses, children, or themselves. Outside Japan, the term bento box may be used (e.g., on English menus for Japanese restaurants).
Bentos can be elaborately arranged in a style called ""kyaraben"" (""character bento""), which are typically decorated to look like popular characters from Japanese animation (anime), comic books (manga), or video games. Another popular bento style is ""oekakiben"" or ""picture bento"". This is decorated to look like people, animals, buildings and monuments or items such as flowers and plants. Contests are often held where bento arrangers compete for the most aesthetically attractive arrangements.

There are somewhat comparable forms of boxed lunches in East Asian countries including mainland China and Taiwan (biànd?ng in Mandarin and ""pi?n-tong"" in Taiwanese Hokkien) and Korea (dosirak), and in Southeast Asian countries such as the Philippines (baon) and Thailand (pin-tou). Hawaiian culture has also adopted localized versions of bento featuring local tastes after over a century of Japanese influence.

There has also been discussion regarding what the bento means for Japanese society and what it represents. The analyses range from a simple semiotic approach to one that outlines the deeper ideological meanings behind the bento.",,"Casuarina Road, Tamako Meal, Casuarina Rd"
